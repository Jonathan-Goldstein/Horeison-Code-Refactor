## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## The Application
For this homework I was tasked with updating the Horiseon Marketing Website in order to meet accessibility criteria. This was done by updating the semantic HTML elements,the structure of the HTML elements as well as adding alt elements for the images. A descriptive title and meta tags were added to the updated code as well.  Additionally the CSS was updated and comments were added to bothe the css and html elements.
